\section{Monads, separation and effects}\label{sec:monads}

In Haskell, monads are used to separate effectful code from non-effectful code
Used in other settings too: in dependently typed languages, a monad can be used to separate partial programs from total programs (e.g. mtac)

Well known problem with monads in Haskell: if you have some pure code, which you now want to add effects to, you have to rewrite all your code in monadic style.
	DDC tries to address the version of this problem concerning writing code for mutable/immutable versions of a data structure. Introduce ``mutability polymorphism'', i.e. instead of IORef Int and Int, we have Int r (where r is the set of locations the object may lie)
